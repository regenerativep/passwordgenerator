# passwordgenerator
generates a random password with the goal of minimal movements

not exactly a command line app right now but you could technically use it as one
after running, it will give you a 16 character password
for each character, the next character will be either on the other side of the keyboard, or next to the current character
only qwerty is implemented right now but it shouldnt be hard to do other keyboard types
